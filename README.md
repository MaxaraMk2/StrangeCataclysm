# Strange Creatures of the Cataclysm
This is a mod website that randomly generates monsters for the free open-source zombie survival roguelike, Cataclysm: Bright Nights (a fork of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead).

Will they fight anything and everything or mind their own business? Will they be dreadfully powerful or laughably harmless? Should you avoid them at all costs or try to presuade one to join you? 

Create as many new monsters as you'd like to add a new unexpected element to your travels!


# How To Use
- Go to the mod website: https://maxaramk2.github.io/StrangeCataclysm/
- Enter the number of monsters you would like to generate.
- Press "GO!".
- Preview the generated monsters (if you'd like)
- Press "Download mod files" to download a zip file containing JSON files for the game to parse.
- Extract the "StrangeCreatures" folder into the mods folder, located in "[game directory]/data/".
- Start the game, activate the mod, and generate a new world with the new monsters.
- Enjoy!


# Future Plans

The mod site is usable in its current state but is still a work-in-progress.

- Add all monster traits and expand options for already implemented traits.
- Fine-tune monster stats for better balance.
- Colour monster stats values based on good or bad (relative to typical player character).
- Allow user to select specific monsters to include in the final download.
- Allow the randomisation to work for Dark Days Ahead as well.
